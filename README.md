# Simple PMPU
Simple parallel MPU concept document. MISC array paradigm.

We have large change from before, since pagin have a memory reference
speed matter, so we depend on programming language the system have.

This is almost the small enough MPU-array everyone at least once dreamed.

# We cannot use this without searching prior results
This is concept and only compileable document.
So to use this, we must search prior patents first.
At least, arm license for condition operations.
And it might be bmov and bzero implementation on mpu
had be patented.

# Not tested
These sources are not tested. And, There exists cacheline
glitch on this implementation.
